# .NET-REST-API

Remembering old stuff and learning new stuff.

This project helped me consolidate and have a better understanding of the .NET platform, VS Code, how to create and access REST APIs, deal with local and database storages (MongoDB), sync vs async methodologies, container virtualization (Docker), container orchestration (Kubernetes), Unit Testing and Testing Driven Development.

Kudos to Julio Casal and freeCodeCamp.
